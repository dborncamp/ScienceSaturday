# Science Saturday
Welcome to the repo for the Science Saturdays Analysis Team. This repo contains the data and scripts used in the analysis. The data come from the various tests conducted as part of the ongoing **Science Saturdays** project. 

The results from the various investigations are published via the project website.

## To collaborate
If there is something you want to have a discussion about, open an issue about it and we can discuss it.

Otherwise if there is something you want to contribute, create a new branch and file a PR to merge it to master.
Get someone else to review the PR and it will be merged and made into the final paper.
It is good practice to have someone look over what you merge to master before you just push it straight to master (looking at you, almost everyone at ST with bad git practices).


## The Data

The raw data can be found in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1clTSVXBHpFB_4yqkAQhzvsDoVax4SZUYpGdbCy7FZ6U/edit#gid=329859720). We have attempted to clean up the data in various ways. Early attempts involved using the notebook found in the `lib` directory. 
Currently, the data is cleaned up manually and placed in the `data` directory. For the most part, these data files are easily readable using pandas. See the README file found in that directory for further details.  

## Future Science Saturdays
Below are some ideas that have been floated for future Science Saturday adventures:

- Should we test different priced vodkas?
- Let's test chocolate!
- Coffee coffee coffee
- Name brand vs generic
